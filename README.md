 The Arabic-to-English translation app is a mobile application that enables users to capture images of Arabic text using their device's camera, recognize the text using an OCR engine, and translate the recognized text to English using the Google Cloud Translation API. The app is designed for iOS devices using the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) framework.
